Webrings are collections of websites linked together in a ring-like circular structure, oftentimes being organized around a specific theme. They peaked in popularity during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but quickly lost traction as search engines got better and better.

### Appeal
Modern webrings are driven by community rather than SEO or click-through rates. So naturally, highly personalized amateur websites are pushed to the forefront. In my experience, this means a significantly higher quality browsing experience.
