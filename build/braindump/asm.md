Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program, known as an assembler. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called 'assembly time'.

Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture. For example, the original [Roller Coaster Tycool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon) (a classic!) was coded in x86 assembly languge.
