Tmux is a terminal multiplexor. It's very useful when working while tunneled through ssh or the likes.

### Basic Commands
Tmux controls are, by default, initialized through `ctrl + o`. Another key is followed to issue a command. For the sake of conciseness, `ctrl + o` will be minimized as `init`.

**create a new window**: `init + shift + 5`
**swap windows**: `init + o`
**kill current window**: `init + x + y`
