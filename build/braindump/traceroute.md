A fun idea for a traceroute game.

The idea is we want to maximize the number of hops to get to a certain IP address. Each time a packet reaches a new device is a "hop," - each device will send back an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). 

The rules are simple: 
1. the path must resolve
2. don't count repeats

the highest I've got so far is a 42-hop chain to a SAT phone in bangladesh
