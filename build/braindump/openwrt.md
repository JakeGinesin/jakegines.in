OpenWRT is an [open-source](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt) linux-based operating system designed for embeded devices, particularly wireless routers. OpenWRT is package-oriented and highly extensible, offering 3000+ packages on top of the base software.

OpenWRT is highly customizable and works at the [forefront of wireless research](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/). Utilizing OpenWRT, one can utilize many features typically only provided by high-end routers.

### OpenWrt vs Tomato vs DD-WRT

[DD-WRT](https://dd-wrt.com/) supports more routers than any of the other competitors, and offers a wide yet stable toolkit. [Tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_(firmware)) is highly streamlined, lightweight, and user-friendly. What does OpenWRT offer?

OpenWRT is the precursor to DD-WRT and Tomato, and proves to be the best option for FOSS enthusiasts. OpenWRT is most like a traditional linux distribution. OpenWRT offers more fine-grained control than the other two options.

PFSense and OPNSense are also pretty useful, and are worth checking out.
