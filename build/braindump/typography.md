Typography can be loosly defined as the styling of text. In interpreting meaning from writing, typography can play a critical role in "setting the tone" so to speak. 

"Typography is the visual component of the written word" â€” Matthew Butterick

### Arrangement
The arrangement of type typically invovles the following:
- typefaces - the variation in size, weight, slope, width, etc. of text
- point sizes - the scale of the text
- line length
- line spacing - the height of each individual line (also called leading)
- letter spacing - the space between each letter
- bi-letter spacing - the spacing between pairs of letters (also called kerning)
