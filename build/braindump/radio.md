As of 2022-08-12 I am studying for my technician radio license. Here are all my notes for that. 

### Explicit Definitions 
- **shorting**: electric current flowing down the unintended path
- **fuse**: fuses remove power from the circuit at a certain amperage. Fuses have a peace of wire in em that melts easily.
- **electric current**: the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit (measured in amperage, or amps). Electric current is measured with an ammeter 
- **interlock**: makes the state of two mechanisms mutually dependent. for example, a mechanical interlock will be required to connect before the institution of any sort of current flowing through the system
- **alternating current (AC)**: current can travel in both directions
- **direct current (DC)**: current travels in one direction only
- **volts**: force at which am ampere is pushed 
- **American AC (alternating current) standard**: 120 Volts @ 60 hz
- **turnbuckle**: used to adjust tension or the lengths of ropes, cables, ties, etc - [wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnbuckle)
- **"RF" energy**: Radio frequency energy
- **ionization**: the process of removing an election from an atom. This is dangerous for biological life because living rely on consistent genetic material (whose structure need not be changed nor altered). Different wavelengths have certain energy levels, and therefore have different abilities to ionize atoms. Radio frequency, being at the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum, does not have enough energy for ionization.
- **duty cycle**: another phrase for the cycle of operation 
- **FCC (Federal Communications Commission)**: regulators of amateur radio (and radio in general)
- **phonetic alphabet**: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu (used to identify letters precisely. was popularized by NATO)
- **radio beacon**: a device that marks a single location and transmits a continuous signal - [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_beacon)
- **FCC space station**: The FCC considers amateur stations located more than 50km above the earth's surface. See the approved space station list [here](https://www.fcc.gov/approved-space-station-list)
- **"RACES"**: Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service
- **Radio Wave Propagation**: radio waves propagate, or move, from transmitter to reciver either through ground waves, sky waves, free space waves, and open field waves 
- **Single Sideband**: A form of amplitude modulation that consumes less bandwidth (Hz), so less energy. 
- **SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)**: indicates quality of "impedance match" (energy match) between radio and antenna system. The goal is to have 1:1 ratio. Energy, in this case, implying the amplitude of the sine wave. 
- **Repeater Offset**: the *offset* between a repeater's transmit and receive frequencies
- **Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling** (DTMF): telecommunication signaling system - [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling)

- **CQ**: code by wireless ham radio operators. transmitting these letters is an invitation for any operators listening to respond. [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQ_(call))
- **Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System (CTCSS)**: This is a type of in-band signaling that's used to reduce the annoyance of listening to other users on a shared two-way radio communication channel - [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System)
- **Squelch**: a "squelch" is a circuit that suppresses the audio output of a reciever in the absence of a strong input signal. In other words, it enforces a minimum of a sense for audio levels. Squelch works by adding a low-frequency audio tone to the voice. If that tone is not audible or there's a different tone, that user will be "squelched" using CTCSS circuitry.

- **Gateway**: An amateur radio station that connects other amateur stations to the internet

### Misc. Notes
- the exothermic nature of the discharging reaction for batteries can cause a lot of excess heat - therefore, it's important to gradually discharge batteries
- capacitors maintain charge after the circuit's amps drops to 0. in the case of power supplies (which have tons of capacitors), they can stay electrically charged for a long time
- don't climb a radio tower without a helper/observer!
- grounding requirements (the nature of the resistance and type of grounding for your amateur radio tower) depends on local electrical codes
- the **radiation type** of radio signals is **non-ionizing**, meaning the radiation does not have enough energy to remove elections from an atom. 
- radio waves move at the speed of light (vroom)
- watts is a rate (julues per second)
- FCC has radio-frequency exposure regulations 
- There are different kinds of burns other than just thermal - radiation burns exist. Antennas during transmission are *hot*, but it's because of their waves, not necessarily their temp. 
- amateures may contact the international space station :o
- radio repeating exists! recieve + retransmit. there are services for this. Echolink is a good example. 
- higher frequency, higher offset (generally)
- you must always identify on the air when transmitting except when controlling model craft (see: part 97 in FCC legislation)
- Ohm's law: E = I x R (Volts = Amps X Ohms)
- Power = Current x Voltage (Watts = Amps x Volts)
- FCC is king of amateur, btw. 
- amateurs cannot interfere with non-amateur stations
- 1 micro = 1,000,000 pico
- the ability for an object to store electrical charge is measured by the farad
- initialize communications with call signs (return the station's call sign followed by yours)
- valid technician class call sign format: KF1XXX 
- English is the primary identification language
- The **henry** is the **unit of inductance**
- Potentiometers measure displacement of electricity in any given direction, so they measure resistance. It can also be configured as a variable resistor (and therefore can be a volume adjuster. [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer)
- "automatic control" means control where *there isn't a control operator present at the control point*. So like, any computer-controlled radio tower (e.g. a repeater)
- VHF and UHF radiowaves don't bounce off the ionosphere due to their small size, so they need a bit of help to propagate over the horizon (or over the line of sight). Certain weather events such as auroras can help in this case, but we usually can rely on "tropospheric scatter" to handle this. Essentially, signals are reflected back to earth randomly.  
- any licensed radio-er can select a license for vanity reasons!
- the louder your voice, the greater the amplitude of the signal. therefore, when you're overdeviating your modulator (which you want to be 1:1 with the reciever), you can solve the problem by talking a bit quieter
- voltometer measures electric potential
- 146.520MHz is the national simplex calling frequency for 2m bands. 
- one operator/primary station license may be held at any one time
- radio signals *generally* do not penatrate dirt or rock very well. Knife's edge diffraction generally occurs when waves hit a sharp edge, and it allows radio signals to go around/over mountains. [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction)
- when measuring resistance with an ohmmeter, you don't have to worry about powering the circuit
- FT8 uses audio input and output of a computer running WSJT-X software
- yagi -> greatest gain
- the higher the frequency, the more RF energy is absorbed by water and solids
- wavelength (in meters) = 300 / frequency (mHz)
- CW signal minumum : 150
- multimeter: voltage and resistance
- Meteor scatter comunication is done by refecting radio waves off ionized particles in the ionoshphere (part of the atmosphere) from meteors passing through. 
- Forward current -> passing through LED (light-emitting diode) to emit light
- technicians max out at 200w power
- club station license grants must have at least 4 members
- no indecent/obscene language on the radio!
- common impedance of coaxial cables used in amateur radio is 50 ohms
- transistors have the potential to provide power gain
- SSB voice has 3kHz bandwidth
- vegitation (plants) absorb UHF!
- emergency situations allow all classes of amatuer radio users to operate outside of their designated frequencies
- CW has the least bandwidth
- "Spin fading" implies rotation of the satellite and the antennas

### Reflection
I had no idea before I started studying for my technician license that radio was such a rabbit hole. I'm satisfied having learned as much as I did, and I'm eager to continue my radio journey.
