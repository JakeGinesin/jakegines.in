Dotfiles are used to customize your computer's software. The "dotfiles" name is derived from configuration files in Unix, as they often start with a dot (i.e. .git and .zshrc).

### Dotfiles + Git
Combining Dotfiles, Git, and a service like Github, a user can store their specialized configuration and, if needed, easily install it to another computer.
