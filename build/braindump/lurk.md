Lurk is a Turing-complete programming language where program execution can be proved in zero-knowledge. This is extremely fucking sick by the way.

# ZK-Snarks
A ZK-Snark is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. That is, the prover can just provide this shit, and the verifier can just verify this shit. Then, there's nothing else they really need to do. There are many many steps needed to construct one of these bad boys.

# Notes About Lurk
- Lurk is separated into two components: the front-end, which is essentially the lisp language itself, and the back-end, which is the stuff that is actually used to generate proofs etc.
