I prefer firefox over chromium-based browsers. Because firefox is fully open-source, forks exist; of those forks, I daily drive librewolf, a privacy-oriented fork of firefox. 

I have a "startpage" I made - e.g., a custom page that's opened whenever I open my browser. Find mine on github [here](https://github.com/JakeGinesin/startpage). Also see [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/).

I really like using firefox's inbuilt shortcuts to navigate with insane speed. I prefer to just get used to firefox's default stuff so I can still navigate with the same speed whenever I use other machines. Here are my favorites:
- `control + [`, `control + ]` - move forwards or backwards
- `alt + home` - return home (back to my startpage)
- `control + l` - highlight URL bar
- `control + b` - access bookmarks
- `control + tab` - move right one tab
- `control + shift + tab` - move left one tab
- `control + t` - new blank tab
- `control + shift + t` - restore closed tab 

I also have my default search engine set as Wikipedia! 

## Vimium
After seeing how neat [Qutebrowser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutebrowser) is, I've decided to add the vimium extension to librewolf. Yeah, it's kind of cringe. But, it allows me to [search webpages](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/oldhelp/vim/searching.html), which is nice. 

More hotkeys:
- `/pattern` -> to search for (and select) a pattern. `enter` to move through it.
- `j/k` -> move up and down a webpage 
- `f6` -> de-select the URL (such that you can use the above two hotkeys)

this is a fucking fantastic way to increase my speed when browsing.

Edit 14 sept 2023: I learned you don't actually need vimium for this. neat!

## Searching bookmarks with hotkeys
I learned you can use the URL bar to search certain things with certain hotkeys.
- `* [query]` - search bookmakrs
- `% [query]` - search tabs and jump to its
- `^ [query]` - search history
