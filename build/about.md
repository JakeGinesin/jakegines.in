Hi! I'm **Jake Ginesin**, and I *love* space.

I'm an undergraduate at **Northeastern University** pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematics. I'm currently employed as a researcher working in Northeastern's [Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) where I employ formal methods to analyze internet protocols. Below are a few of my (non-space) interests, and can serve as conversation starters if you'd like: 

• **Mathematics**. Mainly logic, category theory, and formal methods.
• **Security**. Verification, cryptography, and network security. 
• **Urbanism**. Public transportation, urban planning.
• **Geopolitics and national security**. Mostly Europe, Russia, and China.
• **Fitness**. Endurance and strength training. 
• **Reading**. Sci-fi, history, biography.

### Hiring
If you're interested in **hiring me**—here's my [résumé](/assets/cv-sept23.pdf)

I often get asked about my computing setup, so I created this section to link it whenever. 

**Hardware**

- **Alternate Laptop**: x220 Thinkpad - i5 2430M, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD. Tri-booting Arch Linux, Linux Mint, and Windows. For if my main laptop is out of commission.
