lap -> Laptop Stickers

Hi, 

You may have gotten to this page from a scanning a QR code, or from just browsing my site. Either way, hi. 

I've always thought laptop stickers are a cool and unique way to express yourself. So, I thought it'd be interesting to compile the most common laptop stickers from Northeastern and beyond! MIT students did [something similar](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/laptop-stickers-of-mit/) a couple years ago.  

So, if you'd like, please email me your laptop stickers at ginesin (dot) j (at) northeastern (dot) edu. A little blurb about yourself would be cool too. To provide some incentive, I'll throw some money your way if you do :D

For an example of what to do, here's a picture of my laptop:

### Followup
Along with gathering general statistics, I think it'd be interesting to fine-tune [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), novel image generation software, to produce the "average" Northeastern student's laptop stickers. To do so, I'll probably follow the steps in [this blog post](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2022/10/25/the-guide-to-fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-with-your-own-images).

Once I'm done my analysis, I'll post my results in the form of another blogpost. Maybe I'll create an email list to notify interested people. I'll see.
