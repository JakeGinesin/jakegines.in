<h2 class='header unselectable' style='margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:8px;' id='Misc.Notes'>Misc. Notes</h2> 
• the exothermic nature of the discharging reaction for batteries can cause a lot of excess heat - therefore, it's important to gradually discharge batteries
<br> 
• capacitors maintain charge after the circuit's amps drops to 0. in the case of power supplies (which have tons of capacitors), they can stay electrically charged for a long time
<br> 
• don't climb a radio tower without a helper/observer!
<br> 
• grounding requirements (the nature of the resistance and type of grounding for your amateur radio tower) depends on local electrical codes
<br> 
• the  <span class="bold">radiation type</span>  of radio signals is  <span class="bold">non-ionizing</span>, meaning the radiation does not have enough energy to remove elections from an atom. 
<br> 
• radio waves move at the speed of light (vroom)
<br> 
• watts is a rate (julues per second). watts represents power.
<br> 
• FCC has radio-frequency exposure regulations 
<br> 
• There are different kinds of burns other than just thermal - radiation burns exist. Antennas during transmission are  <i>hot</i>, but it's because of their waves, not necessarily their temp. 
<br> 
• amateures may contact the international space station :o
<br> 
• radio repeating exists! recieve + retransmit. there are services for this. Echolink is a good example. 
<br> 
• higher frequency, higher offset (generally)
<br> 
• you must always identify on the air when transmitting except when controlling model craft (see: part 97 in FCC legislation)
<br> 
• Ohm's law: E = I x R (Volts = Amps X Ohms)
<br> 
• Power = Current x Voltage (Watts = Amps x Volts)
<br> 
• FCC is king of amateur, btw. 
<br> 
• amateurs cannot interfere with non-amateur stations
<br> 
• 1 micro = 1,000,000 pico
<br> 
• the ability for an object to store electrical charge is measured by the farad
<br> 
• initialize communications with call signs (return the station's call sign followed by yours)
<br> 
• valid technician class call sign format: KF1XXX 
<br> 
• English is the primary identification language
<br> 
• The  <span class="bold">henry</span>  is the  <span class="bold">unit of inductance</span>
<br> 
• Potentiometers measure displacement of electricity in any given direction, so they measure resistance. It can also be configured as a variable resistor (and therefore can be a volume adjuster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a>
<br> 
• "automatic control" means control where  <i>there isn't a control operator present at the control point</i>. So like, any computer-controlled radio tower (e.g. a repeater)
<br> 
• VHF and UHF radiowaves don't bounce off the ionosphere due to their small size, so they need a bit of help to propagate over the horizon (or over the line of sight). Certain weather events such as auroras can help in this case, but we usually can rely on "tropospheric scatter" to handle this. Essentially, signals are reflected back to earth randomly.  
<br> 
• any licensed radio-er can select a license for vanity reasons!
<br> 
• the louder your voice, the greater the amplitude of the signal. therefore, when you're overdeviating your modulator (which you want to be 1:1 with the reciever), you can solve the problem by talking a bit quieter
<br> 
• voltometer measures electric potential
<br> 
• 146.520MHz is the national simplex calling frequency for 2m bands. 
<br> 
• one operator/primary station license may be held at any one time
<br> 
• radio signals  <i>generally</i>  do not penatrate dirt or rock very well. Knife's edge diffraction generally occurs when waves hit a sharp edge, and it allows radio signals to go around/over mountains. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a>
<br> 
• when measuring resistance with an ohmmeter, you don't have to worry about powering the circuit
<br> 
• FT8 uses audio input and output of a computer running WSJT-X software
<br> 
• yagi -> greatest gain
<br> 
• the higher the frequency, the more RF energy is absorbed by water and solids
<br> 
• wavelength (in meters) = 300 / frequency (mHz)
<br> 
• CW signal minumum : 150
<br> 
• multimeter: voltage and resistance
<br> 
• Meteor scatter comunication is done by refecting radio waves off ionized particles in the ionoshphere (part of the atmosphere) from meteors passing through. 
<br> 
• Forward current -> passing through LED (light-emitting diode) to emit light
<br> 
• technicians max out at 200w power
<br> 
• club station license grants must have at least 4 members
<br> 
• no indecent/obscene language on the radio!
<br> 
• common impedance of coaxial cables used in amateur radio is 50 ohms
<br> 
• transistors have the potential to provide power gain
<br> 
• SSB voice has 3kHz bandwidth
<br> 
• vegitation (plants) absorb UHF!
<br> 
• emergency situations allow all classes of amatuer radio users to operate outside of their designated frequencies
<br> 
• CW has the least bandwidth (it's continuous, so of course)
<br> 
• "Spin fading" implies rotation of the satellite and the antennas
<br> 
• NTSC -> Never The Same Color
<br> 
• ARQ -> Error Detection
