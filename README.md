# jakegines.in
The open-sourced code for my personal website, [jakegines.in](https://jakegines.in). This site features a custom markdown parser and [static site generator](https://jakegines.in/blog/2022/gen), which helps reduce the friction between creating content and publishing it. This repository is automatically updated on deployment, but not all assets and scripts used in the live site are included in this repository. 

If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please don't make a pull-request or open an issue. Instead, please email me.
